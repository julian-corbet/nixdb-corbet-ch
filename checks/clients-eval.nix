# Evaluates modules/clients.nix for real against `lib.evalModules` and asserts what it resolves,
# plus the integrity of both catalogues and the direction of the reference between them.
#
# Here for the reason every sibling states for its own version of this file: `nix flake check` does
# not evaluate `nixosModules`/`systemManagerModules` on its own, so a green check on this repository
# without it would prove nothing but flake syntax.
#
# ── WHAT IT PROVES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   - the whole resolution path terminates in both directions: an empty selection resolves to
#     nothing on every plane a backend reads, and a full selection resolves to every entry exactly
#     once;
#   - THE LOAD-BEARING INVARIANT: `archPackages` and `aurPackages` never intersect. One AUR name
#     reaching a pacman list aborts the entire pacman transaction with "target not found" and
#     takes every unrelated package in the same converge down with it;
#   - the NixOS plane is honest about the one entry no nixpkgs derivation exists for -- it is
#     absent from `nixosPackages` and present, by name, in `unavailableOnNixos`;
#   - each group's own defining field is present and the fields of the other groups are not, which
#     is the mechanical form of the boundary the catalogue's header argues in prose;
#   - the cluster catalogue does not reference the client catalogue at all, in either direction of
#     naming -- the one property that would otherwise break the cluster side every time a package
#     moved between repositories.
#
# Deliberately pkgs-FREE beyond `pkgs.emptyFile` for the derivation shell. Every question here is a
# question about NAMES and LISTS. Whether a name is in a repository today, and whether a nixpkgs
# attribute still forces, are facts about the world that change without this repository changing --
# see ../experiments/verify-package-names.sh.
