# THE VERIFICATION CONTRACT every name in lib/clients.nix has met, runnable. Point it at the
# catalogue and it answers every question that matters before a name reaches a host -- which is why
# adding an entry is a one-line change rather than a research project.
#
# Run it by hand after touching the catalogue. Repository membership and attribute liveness are
# facts about the world: they change without this repository changing, and no eval-time check can
# see either (which is exactly the line checks/clients-eval.nix's own header draws around itself).
#
# FOUR SOURCES, AND NONE OF THEM IS REDUNDANT:
#
#   1. archlinux.org's package search API  -- upstream Arch, the ONLY authority for `aur = false`.
#      `pacman -Si` is not: on an Arch derivative it also resolves that derivative's own
#      repositories, so a name can pass it cleanly and be in no upstream Arch repository at all --
#      which would make `aur = false` correct on the machine running this script and a
#      whole-transaction abort on a plain Arch box ("target not found" fails `pacman -S`
#      ATOMICALLY and takes every unrelated package in the same converge with it).
#   2. the AUR RPC                         -- the authority for `aur = true`.
#   3. the nixpkgs attribute, FORCED       -- `builtins.seq p.drvPath`, never `hasAttrByPath`.
#      nixpkgs implements a rename as `<old> = throw "...";`, which keeps the key present and only
#      fails when the value is demanded. This catalogue found two such attributes in one sitting --
#      see ../studies/mariadb-client-and-mysql-client-both-throw.md.
#   4. `pacman -Si`, if pacman is present  -- informational: what THIS host resolves.
#
# AN ENTRY MAY CARRY `nixpkgs = null`, meaning no derivation exists at all. Those are listed rather
# than checked, and listing them is the point: a null that quietly became checkable (somebody
# packaged the tool) is a catalogue improvement waiting to be made, and a null that was never
# verified in the first place is a guess. Either way the reader sees the name.
#
# Plus the two cross-checks that a name existing on both platforms cannot pass on its own: the
# homepage against pacman's URL (a pair pointing at two different projects), and -- with
# `--surface` -- the actual contents of `bin/`, because two names for one project at one version
# can still install different commands. The Postgres entry is the reason that check exists; see
# ../studies/psql-is-in-postgresql-libs-not-postgresql.md.
#
# NAMES ARE READ OUT OF lib/clients.nix, never hand-maintained in this file -- a duplicated list
# goes stale in both directions, silently skipping entries that were added and still "verifying"
# entries that were removed.
#
# Usage: ./experiments/verify-package-names.sh [--surface]
#   --surface   additionally realize each nixpkgs attribute and list its bin/ directory. Downloads
#               from the binary cache, so it is opt-in rather than the default.
