# nixdb's client policy: the selection surface for ../lib/clients.nix, and the package-name lists a
# host's own reconciler consumes. Installs nothing itself.
#
# THIS MODULE IS ALSO THE ARCH BACKEND, and there is deliberately no second file behind
# `systemManagerModules.default`. Same conclusion the sibling repos reached once their platform-
# specific work moved elsewhere: on Arch there is nothing here to install FROM -- the lists below
# are published and the host's own pacman reconciler consumes them -- so an `arch.nix` whose entire
# body was `imports = [ ./clients.nix ];` would be a file that exists to be an indirection.
#
#   nixarch.packages.pacman = config.nixdb.clients.archPackages;
#   nixarch.packages.aur    = config.nixdb.clients.aurPackages;
#
# PUBLISHED, NOT WIRED, and that is a choice rather than an omission. This module could assign
# `nixarch.packages.*` directly. It does not, for the reason every catalogue repo in this family
# also does not: a host almost always concatenates several catalogues into one reconciler list, and
# a module that assigns into a FOREIGN namespace both hard-depends on that namespace existing and
# takes the concatenation point away from the one file that can see every catalogue at once.
#
# NO `distro` OPTION HERE, unlike some siblings. That option exists in a catalogue where an
# AUR-only name is carried by SOME Arch derivative's own repository, so which of the two lists an
# entry lands on depends on the host. Nothing catalogued here has that property: all three AUR
# entries were checked against a live CachyOS host's own repositories as well as upstream Arch and
# resolve in neither, so `aur = true` is the whole answer everywhere and an option deciding
# nothing would still read as though it did. It is a two-line addition (an `archRepoOn` field and
# this option) the day an entry needs it, and the sibling repositories already have the exact
# shape to copy.
#
# ONE NAMESPACE. Everything declared here lives under `nixdb`, like every repo in this family; the
# client surface is nested at `nixdb.clients` so it cannot collide with the cluster surface
# (`nixdb.operators` / `nixdb.instances` / `nixdb.tools`) that shares the namespace.
